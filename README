This is an alpha version of the core module diagnostics.

It is based on the 5.7.3 distribution, with a few
bugs fixed and a few features added. Yet, you can
retrofit your 5.6.0 (or later) installation
with this updated module.

INSTALLATION

First, backup you Perl directory tree (you always do that when you install
any alpha-version module, don't ya?). Backup also the splain script
from /usr/local/bin or wherever.

Then the usual 4-step incantation:
  perl Makefile.PL
  make
  make test
and with the proper authorization level
  make install

ALPHA WARNING

Please note that this is an alpha version. A few words of caution:
- The API may change.
- The naming scheme for perldiag files may change.
- Translations exist only for 5.6.0, 5.6.1 and 5.7.3. Other Perl versions
will have to do with either one.
- You get French documentation even if you do not understand French.
- splain has not been tested.
- The module should work on exotic architectures (VMS, Mac OS
Classic) thanks to File::Spec, but I have not tested that.


DISTRIBUTION

This is a core module, therefore it will be distributed within
the standard Perl distribution (I hope). 

But at the same time, the module will exist as a separate 
one in CPAN, because this archive will contain files that
do not belong in the standard Perl distribution: 
translated podfiles, and test files.

Also, the new diagnostics module will appear in Perl 5.8.1 at
the soonest, so people who still use a version from 5.6.0 to
5.8.0 might want to retrofit their installations.

CONTACT

For the 1.2 version, write to me, JFORGET@cpan.org. Do not try the
Perl-5 Porters yet.
